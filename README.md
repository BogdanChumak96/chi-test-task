## Description

üöó The Car List Application is a web application that displays a table of cars. The table contains columns such as Company, Model, VIN, Color, Year, Price, Availability, and Actions. The application supports local pagination, allowing users to navigate through the car list. The search functionality at the top of the table allows users to search across all car entries.

The Actions column in the table includes a dropdown menu with options for Edit and Delete. Selecting the Edit option opens a modal window where users can edit certain fields such as Color, Price, and Availability. The Company, Model, VIN, and Year fields are disabled in the edit mode. Selecting the Delete option opens a modal window to confirm the deletion.

The Car List Application also includes an "Add car" button that opens an add modal. The add modal is similar to the edit modal, but all fields are enabled and empty by default.

All user actions, including editing, deleting, and adding cars, affect the table. The application ensures that the data is saved between page reloads.

## Technologies Used

The car list application is implemented using the React framework.
